Objective: Submit your paper in time!!

Tired from last night, you turned off your alarm when it rang at 8 a.m. and tried to get some quality sleep. 
You wake up 6 hours later, and you remember that you have a paper is due in less than an hour!!
Luckily you already wrote the paper, but you still need to submit it before the deadline.

Unfortunately, you lost a couple things which you will need to find before you can submit:

a charger: Your laptop died, and you can't submit your paper if your laptop doesn't work!
a usb drive: The only copy of your paper is in this usb!
your lucky mug: You have had your lucky mug with you for every assignment, how could you possibly go without it?
