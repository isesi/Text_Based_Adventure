## Objective: Submit Your Paper on Time!

You’ve already written your paper — great! But disaster strikes:  
You wake up at **2:00 p.m.**, six hours after turning off your 8:00 a.m. alarm. Your paper is due in less than an hour, the clock is ticking!.

### The Problem

Before you can submit your paper, you must find three essential items you've misplaced:

- **Charger**  
  Your laptop is dead. You can't submit your paper without powering it up.

- **USB Drive**  
  The only copy of your paper is saved here. No USB, no submission.

- **Lucky Mug**  
You've had this mug with you for every assignment you've submitted. You can't go without it now!

### Find all the items and submit your paper before the deadline!!
